# RQA-Linguistic-synchrony
Processing code for math discussion data and computation of RQA indices

The .ipynb file is for data preparation, including text preprocessing, converting tokens to numbers, equalizing the post length and merge utternace-level number list into conversations.  

The .R code is for generating the RQA indices (RR, DET, NLINE, etc) and generating the recurrence plots. The input of the R file is the output from the python file.
